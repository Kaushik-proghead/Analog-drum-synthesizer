Analog Drum Synthesizer (TR-606 Style Kick Drum)

Designed and implemented a minimal analog kick drum circuit using a single op-amp, 2 capacitors, and 2 resistors to generate a resonant low-frequency thump.

Applied RC time-constant and resonance principles to tune the circuit for ~60â€“80 Hz response, replicating the tonal characteristics of classic drum machines.

Gained hands-on experience with op-amp filter design, impulse excitation, and decay shaping for percussive sound synthesis.
